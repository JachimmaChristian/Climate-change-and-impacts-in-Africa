# Climate-change-and-impacts-in-Africa
This project analyzed the state of climate change in Africa using three datasets:

IEA-EDGAR CO2: Data on CO2 emissions by country from 1970 to 2021.
Temperatures: Annual temperature data for four African countries (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Tunisia).
Country information: Names and regions of African countries.
Aims:

Analyze trends in CO2 levels across African regions.
Investigate the relationship between CO2 levels and time.
Compare CO2 levels across different regions.
Identify the top industries contributing to CO2 emissions in each region.
Predict future CO2 levels for each region.
Assess the impact of CO2 levels on annual temperature in the selected African countries.
Findings:

CO2 levels have increased significantly across all African regions since 1970.
There is a positive correlation between time and CO2 levels in all regions.
Significant differences in CO2 levels exist between some regions, but not all.
The "Residential and Other Sectors" and "Main Activity Electricity and Heat Production" industries are major contributors to CO2 emissions in most regions.
Predicted CO2 levels are expected to continue rising in all regions by 2025.
There is a statistically significant positive relationship between CO2 levels and annual temperature in the selected African countries. A one-unit increase in log10 CO2 is associated with a small but statistically significant increase in temperature.
Overall, the project highlights the growing concern of climate change in Africa and emphasizes the need for regional and international efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate its impact on temperature and other environmental factors.
